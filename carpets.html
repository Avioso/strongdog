	<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">My name is Joshua Pettit, and I am looking for a way to make some money. I will vacume, carpet clean, and then re-vacume your carpets. I charge $75 for every floor, and $30 for suplies(not per floor.) I will do one SMALL room of your house for free as an example. If you would like this, you can call or text "385-463-7336" OR send a gmail to "josh@pettits.net". Put in the time, date, and adress you want. I will try to respond within 1 or 2 days, and will tell you if those times work. I will need a place to get warm water, and a bathroom.</p>
